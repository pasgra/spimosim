<h2>About the model</h2>
<p>
Conway's Game of Life[1] is a mathematical game with very simple rules but complex dynamics.
<p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Every cell (pixel) has eight neighbors. A cell with less than 2 neighbors dies from loneliness and a cell with more than 3 neighbors dies from overpopulation. If a dead cell has 3 neighbors, a new one is born.
