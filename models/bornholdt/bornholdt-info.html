<h2>About the model</h2>
<p>
The Bornholdt model was proposed by Stefan Bornholdt in 2001 [1] as an Ising
model with stock market like behavior with bubbles, crashes between power law
distributed phases of stability.
</p>
<p>
In the original paper Bornholdt used an 32x32 lattice with periodic boundary
condition and random serial updates.
</p>
<p>
The parameters are the inverse temperature β, the global coupling α and the
local coupling j.
